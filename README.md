I just tumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Borderline. Holy hell, what a ride. I'm tired. You know that feeling when your brain’s been through a blender? Yeah, that. It’s like they took all the bizarre elements from every dream I’ve ever had and threw them onto the screen. This 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 got in my head and mixed things up; I’m still not quite sure if I enjoyed it or if it was some kind of artistic sped-up slap to the face.

There were moments I swear I thought, Is this an art 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮? Or a weird quest to confuse the hell out of me? I mean, the characters, how do I even begin? Some of them felt like they were straight out of a cartoon on a serious acid trip, especially that one guy - what was his name, Steve? I don’t even know if he was supposed to be funny, but he was. Honestly, sometimes it’s like they were pulling people from my nightmares and giving them roles.

> Speaking of Steve, his whole arc about self-discovery or existential dread or whatever it was, felt like someone tried to explain a chef's special using only bubbles. It left as much sense as that time I found my shoe in the fridge with a post-it note saying be yourself attached to it.

Am I the only one who thought the soundtrack was schizophrenic? One scene, it’s all moody violins, and the next, disco beats like it's trying to rouse someone from eternal slumber. Yet, somehow, it worked in that jam-packed cacophony of unexpected feelings.

And that ending? I mean, what the?! People say life doesn't wrap up neatly, but this   was basically that concept with a fog machine and strobe lights. I walked out and had to sit in my car like “What did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩?” Not sure if I’d have the guts to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   again to try to piece together whatever the message was.

    string  Title = Borderline;
    Console.WriteLine(What did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩?  +  Title + ?);

Folks in the theater looked as puzzled as I felt. I swear, one guy literally said, “Well, that happened.” Accurate enough. With  s like this, you can’t help but walk away with more questions than answers. Should you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   yourself? Only if you’re ready to have your brain turned into a fascinating, albeit perplexing, scrambled egg.
